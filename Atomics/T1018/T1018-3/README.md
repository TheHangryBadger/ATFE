### Network Traffic
During testing using one domain controller and one windows 10 host interconnected via a pfsense, network traffic during command execution showed a small spike in TCP packet traffic, 61% of which was DCERPC.

The traffic appears to only involve the client machine and the domain controller.

Almost at the very end, a DRSUAPI packet series is used to get the actual answers for the identities of the domain controllers using a DsGetDomainControllerInfo request/response. After which the connection is unbound and later disconnected.
