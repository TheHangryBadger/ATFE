# Atomic Testing Framework Expanded (ATFE)
Red Canary released some years ago, a framework to perform quick tests called "Atomic Red Teaming". They made a great job and you can check their stuff out  here: https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team <br>
This project aims to expand upon some of these tests by providing contextual information to each one, redefine the tests to better suit what we've experienced was needed in our usage of the framework and framing the tests into attack patterns used in historical attacks to get it more scenario based.

## How to use?
The Red Canary Atomic Red Team Framework has an Invoke-Atomic project which can be imported and run from powershell.
This project will for now focus on manual execution. Each test will contain instructions on how to execute. Please put a comment on the project if anything appears unclear.

## Release plan?
Despite being initially developed for my previous employer, this project is no a passion project which is developed in peoples spare time, release plans are not strict and thus updates to the project will be sporadic.
